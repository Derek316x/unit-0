### Hang Person

Your job is to create a game called "Hang Person" where a user has to guess a predetermined word(s). 

**Here are the rules:**

1. After every guess, you must print out the current state of the game. (e.g. _ _ n _ n _)  
2. You must determine a maximun number of wrong guesses. If the player guesses too many incorrect letters, they lose and the game ends.  
3. If the player looses, provide a message letting them know that they lost.  
4. If they win, provide a message letting them know that they won.

Have fun!
