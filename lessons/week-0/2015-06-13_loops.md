### Objectives

Be able to define, iterate, and control while loops and for loops

### While loops

loop - code that is run over and over again

``` c
while (condition) {
  // do something over and over
}
```

Just like the `if` statement, the condition is a boolean expression. The code in-between the curly braces is the *body* of the loop. 
The body will continue to execute as long as the condition is true. Before every execution of the *body*, the system evaluates
the condition, and if it evaluates false, the loop ends and your code continues to run.

``` c
Exercise: Write a program that tracks how many M&Ms you have left, as you eat them. It should look like this:

100 M&Ms left
eat how many? 20
80 M&Ms left
eat how many? 60
20 M&Ms left
eat how many? 18
2 M&Ms left
eat how many? 2
you ate all the M&Ms
```
